If I had to describe myself in one word, that would be: diversity. I love/live life in its entirety!
Life’s so terribly short, so don’t waste your time :) Originally I come from [Romania Oneşti jud. Bacău](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One%C5%9Fti)),
but nowadays I live in Berlin, Germany.
At the moment I study computer science. Typical computer enthuasiast, you say? Farfetched!
Indeed my main and most important affection are computer systems, networks and **security** etc.
Yet there are some domains like Code Auditing, IT Security, Unix/Linux Kernel/Network/System programming and last but not least
Software Engineering I’m especially interested in.

## *.dornea.nu

Blog, personal portfolio site, development/research platform, bunch of (unusefull) texts, typical nerd geeky site…:-)
It’s up to you how you’d call it! If you believe it or not, it was a comedy show that made this whole site possible.
bout 2 years ago some funny idea striked me from middle of nowhere and I became fascinated by the idea of having my
own “full name”-domain. Indeed this funny ideea came up when I saw some german comedy show called “Bully Parade”.
For the first time in my life I saw some free-spirited unconventional domain name: www.bullypara.de! :-) Ok,
there are some plenty other similar sites like del.icio.us, sla.ckers.org, ha.ckers.org, code.it etc. …
I think you got the point xD

## This blog
Due to my vast interest in Linux/Unix stuff, this site mostly deals with *NIX related topics.
Already early in age I’ve started coding on *NIX-platforms.
Many years of experience with system/kernel/network administration have brought wide knowledge to me
and improved my coding skills. You’ll find here some of my projects which I’ve consired worth to be published.
Besides that you’ll find interesting articles on some topics I’ve dealt with.
I hope you appreciate my efforts and readiness to improve this site and keep it up-to-dated.
I really like to share my knowlegde with other people with the hope to extend mine.
Enjoy your stay and don’t forget to write comments!
