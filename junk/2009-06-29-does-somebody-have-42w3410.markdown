I&#8217;ve searched the whole Internet for that tiny thing (about 35 mm x 35 mm x 3mm). In Germany I couldn&#8217;t find it! Only Ebay could show me some offers&#8230; from the States! WTF? Finally I could find it on the IBM Online [Shop][1]  and I was quite shocked about its price. 42 € for that little thing? No way! The next days I&#8217;ll try to find another one from a different vendor (with the same measurements). Why does IBM/Lenovo use such tiny components for its Laptops? Maybe because they fit better. But why does it have to be so abnormal, when refering to its dimensions? Ok.. I&#8217;ll try to relax and calm down. Ahh.. I forgotten to mention: Today its my B-Day! So: **Happy Birthday to ME! <img src="http://dornea.nu/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif" alt=":-D" class="wp-smiley" /> **

**EDIT (29.06.2009): I finally ordered one! Now I&#8217;m happy!**
