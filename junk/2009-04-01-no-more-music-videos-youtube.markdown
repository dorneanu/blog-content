This is no April Fool&#8217;s joke! No more music videos for DE users on YouTube! GEMA vs. YouTube! This confllict seems to be almost identical to YouTube&#8217;s media battle in the United Kingdom. According to YouTube, the platform is no longer playing music videos which belong to Germany&#8217;s biggest royalty collections group, GEMA. YouTube has always been the common jukebox at most private partys. Yet it is the biggest (free available) music collection on the web. What now? Until some deal is worked out, we&#8217;ll just have to wait&#8230; Or start updating our own MP3&#8242;s collection xD
