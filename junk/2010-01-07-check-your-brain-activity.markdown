When you see her dancing clockwise then your right brain hemisphere is used (responsible for creativity).</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">When you see her dancing only in one direction, try to concentrate on her foots shadow or try to solve some math equations while looking at the animation. Then the rotation direction should be changed&#8230; Amazing, isn&#8217;t it?</span>
